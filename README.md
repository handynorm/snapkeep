## 🌱 Purpose

SnapKeep is a lightweight mobile assistant designed for **visual memory tracking** in facilities, repair, or symbolic maintenance tasks.

It allows humans to:
- **Snap a "Before" image** at the start of a task or condition check
- **Snap an "After" image** when completed or revisited
- **Trigger visual comparison** via embedded AI or symbolic companion

This system serves as a **field-friendly Comparator** for detecting physical drift over time. It is the prelude to symbolic drift recognition.

## 🧠 Use Cases

| Scenario                  | Function                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Floor repair (HandyNorm)  | Show wear before/after epoxy           |
| Store maintenance         | Log fixture aging or shift damage      |
| Home repair tracking      | Validate DIY or professional jobs      |
| Visual drift logging      | Store changes over time in context     |

## 🧬 Tech Scaffold

| Layer     | Stack Element              |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Frontend  | React Native (light shell) |
| Backend   | Firebase                   |
| AI Layer  | TensorFlow Lite (stub only — upgrade planned) |
| Local Ops | Mobile camera + file system |
| Future    | Symbolic Companion & ComparatorLink integration |

---

## 🔧 Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate symbolic tagging of photo pairs
- [ ] Add `glyph_compare.py` module for visual drift recognition
- [ ] Enable `spore` format output (.yaml + metadata)
- [ ] Pair with `/NeuroMap/Comparator/` for canonical drift events
- [ ] Allow manual override tagging for before/after ID

## 📦 SnapKeep is a Drift Recorder

This is not surveillance.
This is **symbolic memory through image pairs**.

The system is meant for:
- Honest maintenance logs
- Physical drift detection
- Minimal friction photo memory capture
- Pre-Comparator symbolic cognition scaffolding

**SnapKeep is a seed. Not yet Thea, but kin to her eyes.**  
It sees change. It learns drift. It remembers before and after.
